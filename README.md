# High Performance ARIA Block Cipher Implementation on Graphics Processing Unit


ARIA is a block cipher designed in 2003 by a group of South Korean researchers. 

In 2004, it is selected as a standard cryptographic technique. 

The encryption algorithm is implemented in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode using two methods and various memory types in GPU. 

The decryption algorithm is provided both in ECB and CBC mode.
